# Image Template File Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation is intended to cover the design and usage of the packages in this image templating library. This home page serves as a high level overview of the concepts and terminology.

The main readme file for the repository provides code for a basic usage example, but full self-contained examples can be found in the top level [examples folder](../examples). A compilation of the JSON template files used in those example applications, along with other sample template files, is located in the [Examples](Examples.md) file within this documentation.
